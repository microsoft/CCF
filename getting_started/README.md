# Running CCF on a virtual machine

This folder contains two separate ways of creating a Virtual Machine to run CCF. 

1. [azure_vm](./azure_vm/README.md) provides an opinionated way of creating a Virtual Machine on Azure and install CCF for you by cloud-init.
1. setup_vm assumes you have cloned this repository onto your destination Virtual Machine and provides Ansible scripts to setup your VM
