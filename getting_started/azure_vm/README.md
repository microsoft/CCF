This guide is here to give you the bare minimum to get started with CCF. It will walk you through the steps to create a virtual machine in Azure and install CCF on it.

## Prerequisites

You must run this from a bash terminal that you have already logged in to Azure with. If you have not done this, please follow the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

## Create a Virtual Machine
