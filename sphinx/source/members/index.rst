Member Governance
=================

This section describes how a consortium of trusted :term:`members` governs an existing CCF network. It explains how members can submit proposals to CCF and how these proposals are accepted based on the rules defined in the :term:`constitution`.

Before creating a new CCF network, the identity of the initial member(s) of the consortium must be generated. See :ref:`members/adding_member:Generating Member Keys and Certificate`.
