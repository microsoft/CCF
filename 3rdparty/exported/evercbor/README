This directory is the EverCBOR snapshot from EverParse v2025.12.10 (https://github.com/project-everest/everparse/tree/v2025.12.10/src/cbor/pulse/nondet/c)

EverCBOR supports definite-length CBOR without
floating-points. EverCBOR checks for well-formedness and map keys
duplicates during parsing.

This code has been automatically generated from F* code formally
verified for memory safety, arithmetic safety, and functional
correctness.

For more usage information, see the documented example at
