# (e.g. dynamically launched container).
# This sets the --node-address and --public-rpc-address arguments
# based on the IP address of the container (it assumes that the container
# is connected to service-specific network)

# Note: This should become less hacky once https://github.com/microsoft/CCF/issues/2612 is implemented
