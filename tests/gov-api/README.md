This test confirms that CCF presents a governance API compliant with Azure standards. This API is defined in the [azure-rest-api-specs repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/main/specification/confidentialledger/data-plane/Microsoft.ManagedCcf). The OpenAPI document (generated from a source TypeSpec definition) is copied to, to avoid repeatedly fetching the file within tests (and failing when GitHub is flaky). We retain multiple versions, to test compatibility with (continued support for) previously documented API versions.

A full test would try to auto-generate a client from the OpenAPI, and use that to test the governance behaviour. The current test is more narrow - it only aims to call each resource listed in the OpenAPI and confirm that the response meets the declared schema. It is only validating correct shape, and not correct behaviour.
