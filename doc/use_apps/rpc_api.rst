RPC API
=======

Application RPCs are exposed under ``/app`` and require authentication with a valid user identity.
You can read what application endpoints may look like, as generated by the :doc:`:example C++ logging app <build_apps/example_cpp>`, in :doc:`/build_apps/example_rpc_api`.

Built-ins
----------

By default, CCF will also add some built-in endpoints:

   :examples:
   :include:

      /app/tx
