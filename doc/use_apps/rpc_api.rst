RPC API
=======

Application RPCs are exposed under ``/app`` and require authentication with a valid user identity.
This is a sample of what an application endpoint may look like, as generated by the :ref:`example C++ logging app <build_apps/example_cpp>`.

.. openapi:: ../schemas/app_openapi.json
   :examples:
   :include:
      /app/log/.*

Built-ins
----------

By default, CCF will also add some built-in endpoints:

.. openapi:: ../schemas/app_openapi.json
   :examples:
   :include:
      /app/tx
      /app/commit
      /app/receipt
      /app/quote
