TLA+ Specification
==================

The CCF repository includes a formal specification in TLA+ of CCF's consensus algorithm, which is a variant of Raft.

This specification serves two purposes:

1. To catch problematic edge cases in our version of the Raft protocol that may not be trivially found or that may not be covered by tests.
2. To serve as a formal future-proof specification of the protocol as it is intended to function.

The first purpose can be achieved by running the specification with a model checker. While we used `TLC <http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tools.html>`_ which comes built-in with the TLA+ tools, any model checker that works with TLA+ should be possible to make run.

The second purpose is achieved simply with the TLA+ code. However, it is important to understand that the **TLA+ specification has no binding to the actual implementation**. This means that any change in the Raft implementation after the last modification of this specification may not be reflected and can still contain unexpected edge cases. However, comments in the TLA+ code are meant to help make this transition easier. Overall, we expect the CI tests in addition to this model checking to give us a good coverage of the behaviors to expect.

CCF implements various modifications to Raft as it was originally proposed by Ongaro and Ousterhout. Specifically, CCF constrains that only appended entries that were *signed* by the primary can be committed. Any other entry that has *not* been signed is rolled back. Additionally, the CCF implementation introduced a variant of the reconfiguration that is different from the one proposed by the original Raft paper. By default, reconfigurations are done via one transaction (as described :doc:`here </architecture/consensus/1tx-reconfig>`).

The TLA+ specification models the intended behavior of Raft as it is modified for CCF. Below, we explain several core parts of the specification in more detail.

You can find the full specification in the :ccf_repo:`tla/` directory and more information on TLA+ `here <http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/tla.html>`_. Several good resources exist online, one good example is `this guide <https://www.learntla.com>`_.

Running the model checker
-------------------------

The specifications in this repository are implemented for and were checked with the TLC model checker, specifically with the nightly build of TLC. The model checking files are additionally meant to be run via the CLI and not through the toolbox. To make this easier, the scripts in this folder allow you to run TLC easily.

To download and then run TLC, simply execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd tla
    $ ./download_or_update_tla.sh
    $ ./tlc.sh MCccfraft.tla

You can also check the specification including reconfiguration as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ./tlc.sh MCccfraftWithReconfig.tla -config MCccfraft.cfg

Running TLC on our models can take any time between minutes (for small configurations) and days (especially for the full model with reconfiguration) on a 128 core VM (specifically, we used an `Azure HBv3 instance <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/hbv3-series>`_.


.. note::  TLC works best if it can utilize all system resources. For this, the ```tlc.sh``` script already uses the ``-workers auto``` option to use all cores. However, depending on your configuration, you may want to allocate more memory to the Java VM. you can do this by modifying the script and changing the values of ``-Xms2G -Xmx2G``` to enforce the specific RAM usage that you need (2GB in this case). Note that it is useful to fix both minimum and maximum value to increase performance.

.. note::  During development, it helps to use simulation mode which performs a depth-first search of the search tree (instead of the default breadth first that is very slow). Turn on the simulation mode with ``-simulate -depth 100000`` (using a very large number as a maximum depth). Note that this mode never completes (but will find errors in minutes instead of hours).

The given specification consists of four files:

- ``ccfraft.tla`` : The core formal specification that implements CCF Raft.
- ``MCccfraft.tla`` : The model checking implementation for the specification (that uses a static configuration). Sets the constants and can be modified for each run to fine tune the settings, for instance to increase or decrease the size of the model checking.
- ``MCccfraft.cfg`` : The core configuration that defines which invariants are to be checked etc. Usually stays untouched during normal model checking.
- ``MCccfraftWithReconfig.tla``: Analogous to ``MCccfraft.tla`` but with support for reconfiguration.


Building blocks of the TLA+ spec
--------------------------------

.. warning:: This specification was created to verify certain safety properties of the Raft protocol as it is implemented in CCF. In doing so, this specification does not check any liveness guarantees. To allow model checking in a reasonable amount of time, the implementation focuses on the safety guarantees and places certain limitations on the state space to be explored. Since these limitations can lead certain traces of the execution into a deadlock, **liveness is not checkable with this model**.

The core model is maintained in the :ccf_repo:`tla/ccfraft.tla` file, however the constants defined in this file are controlled through a model check file such as :ccf_repo:`tla/MCccfraft.tla`.

This file controls the constants as seen below. In addition to basic settings of how many nodes are to be model checked, the model allows to place additional limitations on the state space of the program.

.. literalinclude:: ../../tla/MCccfraft.tla
    :language: text
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: mc_config
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: mc_config

Possible state transitions in the model
---------------------------------------

During the model check, the model checker will exhaustively search through all possible state transitions. The below snippet defines the possible state transitions at each step. Each of these transitions has additional constraints that have to be fulfilled for the state to be an allowed step. For example, ``BecomeLeader`` is only a possible step if the selected node has enough votes to do so.

.. literalinclude:: ../../tla/ccfraft.tla
    :language: text
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: next_states
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: next_states


Variables and their initial state
---------------------------------

The model uses multiple variables that are initialized as seen below. Most variables are used as a TLA function which behaves similar to a Map as known from Python or other programming languages. These variables then map each node to a given value, for example the state variable which maps each node to either ``Follower``, ``Leader``, ``Retired``, or ``Pending``. In the initial state shown below, all nodes states are set to the ``InitialConfig`` that is set in :ccf_repo:`tla/MCccfraft.tla`.

.. literalinclude:: ../../tla/ccfraft.tla
    :language: text
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: init_values
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: init_values

Basic functions and log changes
-------------------------------

Below, we shortly describe some basic functionality of the Raft model. Note that this is only a selection of the model, please refer to the full model for a full picture.

Timeout
~~~~~~~

Since TLA does not model time, any node can time out at any moment as a next step. Since this may lead to an infinite state space, we limited the maximum term any node can reach. While this would be overly constraining in any actual program, the model checker will ensure to also explore those states that are feasible within these limits. Since interesting traces can already be generated with one or better two term changes, this approach is feasible to model reconfigurations and check persistence.

.. literalinclude:: ../../tla/ccfraft.tla
    :language: text
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: timeout
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: timeout

Signing of log entries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In CCF, the leader periodically signs the latest log prefix. Only these signatures are committable in CCF. We model this via special ``TypeSignature`` log entries and ensure that the commitIndex can only be moved to these special entries.

.. literalinclude:: ../../tla/ccfraft.tla
    :language: text
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: signing
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: signing

Reconfiguration steps
---------------------

The one transaction reconfiguration is already described :doc:`here </architecture/consensus/1tx-reconfig>`. In the TLA+ model, a reconfiguration is initiated by the Leader which appends an arbitrary new configuration to its own log. This also triggers a change in the ``Configurations`` variable which keeps track of all running configurations.

In the following, this ``Configurations`` variable is then checked to calculate a quorum and to check which nodes should be contacted or received messages from.

.. literalinclude:: ../../tla/ccfraft.tla
    :language: text
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: reconfig
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: reconfig
