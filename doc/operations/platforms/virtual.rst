Insecure Virtual
===================

How to use the Insecure Virtual Platform
----------------------------------------
The insecure virtual platform can run on any hardware supported by CCF.

To use the insecure virtual platform, set the enclave type in the :doc:`node configuration <../configuration>` to ``Virtual``.

Attestation
-----------
No attestation is provided with virtual nodes, so nodes using this platform should not be trusted to the same degree as other nodes.
