  Azure Confidential Compute
    `Azure Confidential Compute <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/confidential-compute/>`_ protects the confidentiality and integrity of your data and code while itâ€™s processed in the public cloud.

  Azure DCAP
    Intel SGX Data Centre Attestation Primitives which allows SGX attestation to be used within Microsoft Azure.

  BFT
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance is a type of fault tolerance that expects some nodes in the network to behave maliciously. This usually requires additional messages and checks on inputs that are received from other servers since these inputs are not trusted (in contrast to :term:`CFT` where the servers are expected to behave honestly but may fail). Read more on BFT :ref:`here <overview/consensus/index:BFT Consensus Protocol>`.

  Consensus Protocols
    The term Consensus protocol refers to either :term:`CFT` described  :ref:`here <overview/consensus/index:CFT
    Consensus Protocol>` or :term:`BFT` described :ref:`here <overview/consensus/index:BFT Consensus Protocol>`. Generic Consensus terminology
    will use `primary` node and `backup` node to indicate node responsibility in carrying out the protocol(s). These
    correspond in Raft to `leader` and `follower`. More information about consensus protocols can `be found here
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)>`_.

  Constitution
    JavaScript module that defines possible governance actions, and how members' proposals are validated, resolved and applied to the service.

  CFT
    Crash Fault Tolerance is a type of fault tolerance that allows the system to tolerate network and node failures up to
    a given limit. CFT however does not account for any nodes behaving maliciously (in contrast to :term:`BFT`). Read more on CFT :ref:`here <overview/consensus/index:CFT Consensus Protocol>`.
    

  FLC
    `Flexible Launch Control <https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/blob/master/psw/ae/ref_le/ref_le.md#flexible-launch-control>`_ is a feature of the Intel :term:`SGX` architecture.

  Intel SGX PSW
    Intel SGX Platform SoftWare which manages SGX enclaves loading as well as communication with architectural enclaves. More details `here <https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx>`_.

  Members
    Constitute the consortium governing a CCF network. Their public identity should be registered in CCF.

  Merkle Tree
    `Tree structure <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree>`_ which records the hash of every transaction and guarantees the integrity of the CCF ledger.

  Microsoft Azure
    `Microsoft Azure <https://azure.microsoft.com>`_ is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft-managed data centers.

  Open Enclave
    `Open Enclave SDK <https://openenclave.io/sdk>`_ is an SDK for building enclave applications in C and C++.

  Open Enclave Engine
    `Open Enclave Engine <https://github.com/Microsoft/oe-engine>`_ is a template generation tool for :term:`Azure Confidential Compute`.

  Operators
    Are in charge of operating a CCF network (e.g. adding or removing nodes). Their identities are not registered in CCF.

  SGX
    `Intel Software Guard Extensions <https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx>`_ is a set of instructions that increases the security of application code and data, giving them more protection from disclosure or modification. Developers can partition sensitive information into enclaves, which are areas of execution in memory with more security protection.

  TEE
    `Trusted Execution Environment <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment>`_ is a secure area of a main processor. It guarantees code and data loaded inside to be protected with respect to confidentiality and integrity. Often referred to as "enclave".

  TLS
    `Transport Layer Security <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>`_ is an IETF cryptographic protocol standard designed to secure communications between a client and a server over a computer network.

  Users
    Directly interact with the application running in CCF. Their public identity should be voted in by members before they are allowed to issue requests.
