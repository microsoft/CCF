Install CCF
===========

Requirements
------------

CCF builds and runs on Linux. It is primarily developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04, with Clang 10.
Running CCF with full security guarantees requires :term:`SGX` hardware with :term:`FLC`.

.. note::

    A `virtual` version of CCF can also be run on hardware that does not support SGX. The `virtual` mode provides no security guarantee and is only useful for development and prototyping.

CCF requires the following dependencies to be first installed on your system:

- :term:`Intel SGX PSW`
- :term:`Azure DCAP`
- :term:`Open Enclave`

These dependencies can be conveniently installed using the ``ansible`` playbooks in the CCF repository or `Install`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd <ccf_path>/getting_started/setup_vm/
    $ ./run.sh app-dev.yml

Install
-------

CCF releases are available on the `GitHub repository release page <https://github.com/microsoft/CCF/releases/latest>`_. The documentation you are currently reading describes the `main` branch and behaviour available in the 2.x release candidates.

The CCF Debian package (``ccf_<version>_amd64.deb``) contains the libraries and utilities to start a CCF service and build CCF applications. CCF can be installed as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Set CCF_VERSION to most recent release
    $ export CCF_VERSION=$(curl -ILs -o /dev/null -w %{url_effective} https://github.com/microsoft/CCF/releases/latest | sed 's/^.*ccf-//')
    # Alternatively, set this manually, e.g.
    # export CCF_VERSION=1.0.0
    $ wget https://github.com/microsoft/CCF/releases/download/ccf-${CCF_VERSION}/ccf_${CCF_VERSION}_amd64.deb
    $ sudo apt install ./ccf_${CCF_VERSION}_amd64.deb

Assuming that CCF was installed under ``/opt``, the following commands can be run to verify that CCF was installed successfully:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ /opt/ccf/bin/cchost --version
    CCF host: ccf-<version>

    $ /opt/ccf/bin/sandbox.sh
    No package/app specified. Defaulting to installed JS logging app
    Setting up Python environment...
    Python environment successfully setup
    [16:10:16.552] Starting 1 CCF node...
    [16:10:16.552] Virtual mode enabled
    [16:10:23.349] Started CCF network with the following nodes:
    [16:10:23.350]   Node [0] = https://127.0.0.1:8000
    ...

The CCF install notably contains:

- The ``cchost`` binary required to spin up a CCF application
- The ``cmake`` files required to build CCF applications
- The ``ansible`` playbooks required for :doc:`/contribute/build_setup` (under ``getting_started/``)
- Header files and libraries to build CCF applications (under ``include/`` and ``lib/``)
- A limited set of Python utilities to start a basic CCF service for local testing
- Various utility scripts (see :doc:`/build_apps/demo`)

Uninstall
---------

To remove an installation of CCF, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo apt remove ccf

Unsafe packages
---------------

Separate packages with extremely verbose logging are provided for troubleshooting purposes. Their version always end in ``unsafe`` to make them easily distinguishable.

The extent of the logging in these packages mean that they cannot be relied upon to offer confidentiality and integrity guarantees. They should never be used for production purposes.

From Source
-----------

To build and install CCF from source, please see :doc:`/contribute/build_ccf`.
