Upgrading From Classic API
==========================

Earlier versions of CCF exposed an alternative governance API, now known as the "classic API". The bulk of the endpoints from the classic API have a direct replacement in the new API, as laid out below. Note that the response format may not match exactly. For instance response fields in JSON objects will be ``camelCase`` rather than ``snake_case``, and list responses may now be paged. See the API schema for the new version for a precise description of the response format of each request.

Note that all new APIs require the ``api-version`` query parameter to be set, and will return an error if called without this parameter, or when its value does not match a known API version.
