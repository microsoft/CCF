Classic API (Deprecated)
========================

Available in CCF versions before 5.0.0.

Any request calling a path with a ``/gov`` prefix which does not include the ``api-version`` query parameter is calling the classic API.

.. warning:: This API is deprecated, and will be removed in a future release. See :doc:`/governance/gov_api_schemas/upgrading_from_classic` for a guide to upgrading to a more recent version.

.. openapi:: ../../schemas/gov_openapi.json
