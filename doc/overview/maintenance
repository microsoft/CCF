### Maintenance

In order to keep the CCF network in a healthy state, there are two kinds of maintenance needed; privilaged and un-privilaged. 

**Privileged: Governance**
It's governing the future of the service, what code it runs etc. The actor for this is a member.

Unpriviliged: Operations 
------------------------
It is about maintaining a level of service without changing its nature. The actor for this is an operator.
