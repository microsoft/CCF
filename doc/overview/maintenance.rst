Maintenance
================

In order to keep the CCF network in a healthy state, there are two kinds of maintenance needed; privileged and un-privileged. 

Privileged: Governance
--------------------------
It's governing the future of the service, what code it runs etc. The actor for this is a member.

Unprivileged: Operations
----------------------------
It is about maintaining a level of service without changing its nature. The actor for this is an operator.
