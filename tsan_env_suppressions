# Awkward usages of '*' in this file like '/ds/*ring_buffer.h' are necessary to handle the cases where tsan thinks
# src/ds/ring_buffer.h as src/ds/test/../ring_buffer.h for example

# For partitions_test
deadlock:*/store.h
deadlock:*/untyped_map.h

# For governance_test
race:*/node/*rpc/*frontend.h

# Race between closedir and epoll_ctl.
