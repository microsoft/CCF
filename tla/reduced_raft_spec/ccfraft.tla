----
\* Global variables

\* A set representing requests and responses sent from one server
\* to another. With CCF, we have message integrity and can ensure unique messages.
VARIABLE messages
\* CCF: Keep track of each message sent from each server to each other server
\* and cap it to a maximum
VARIABLE messagesSent
----
\* The following variables are all per server (functions with domain Server).

\* The server's term number.
VARIABLE currentTerm
\* The server's state (Follower, Candidate, or Leader).
VARIABLE state
\* The candidate the server voted for in its current term, or
\* Nil if it hasn't voted for any.
VARIABLE votedFor
serverVars == <<currentTerm, state, votedFor>>

\* The set of requests that can go into the log
VARIABLE clientRequests

\* A Sequence of log entries. The index into this sequence is the index of the
\* log entry. Unfortunately, the Sequence module defines Head(s) as the entry
\* with index 1, so be careful not to use that!
VARIABLE log
\* The index of the latest entry in the log the state machine may apply.
VARIABLE commitIndex
\* The index that gets committed
VARIABLE committedLog
\* Does the commited Index decrease
VARIABLE committedLogDecrease
logVars == <<log, commitIndex, clientRequests, committedLog, committedLogDecrease >>

\* The following variables are used only on candidates:
\* The set of servers from which the candidate has received a RequestVote
\* response in its currentTerm.
VARIABLE votesSent
\* The set of servers from which the candidate has received a vote in its
\* currentTerm.
VARIABLE votesGranted
\* State space limitation: Restrict each node to send a limited amount 
\* of requests to other nodes
VARIABLE votesRequested
candidateVars == <<votesSent, votesGranted, votesRequested>>

\* The following variables are used only on leaders:
\* The next entry to send to each follower.
VARIABLE nextIndex
\* The latest entry that each follower has acknowledged is the same as the
\* leader's. This is used to calculate commitIndex on the leader.
VARIABLE matchIndex
leaderVars == <<nextIndex, matchIndex>>

\* End of per server variables.
----

\* All variables; used for stuttering (asserting state hasn't changed).
vars == <<messages, messagesSent, serverVars, candidateVars, leaderVars, logVars>>

----
\* Helpers

\* The set of all quorums. This just calculates simple majorities, but the only
\* important property is that every quorum overlaps with every other.
Quorum == {i \in SUBSET(Server) : Cardinality(i) * 2 > Cardinality(Server)}

\* The term of the last entry in a log, or 0 if the log is empty.
LastTerm(xlog) == IF Len(xlog) = 0 THEN 0 ELSE xlog[Len(xlog)].term

\* Helper for Send and Reply. Given a message m and set of messages, return a
\* new set of messages with one more m in it.
WithMessage(m, msgs) == msgs \union {m}

\* Helper for Discard and Reply. Given a message m and bag of messages, return
\* a new bag of messages with one less m in it.
WithoutMessage(m, msgs) == msgs \ {m}

\* Add a message to the bag of messages.
\* But only if this exact messages does not already exist 
Send(m) == messages' = 
    WithMessage(m, messages)

\* Remove a message from the bag of messages. Used when a server is done
\* processing a message.
Discard(m) == messages' = WithoutMessage(m, messages)

\* Combination of Send and Discard
Reply(response, request) ==
    messages' = WithoutMessage(request, WithMessage(response, messages))

\* Return the minimum value from a set, or undefined if the set is empty.
Min(s) == CHOOSE x \in s : \A y \in s : x <= y
\* Return the maximum value from a set, or undefined if the set is empty.
Max(s)         == CHOOSE x \in s          : \A y \in s : x >= y
MaxWithZero(s) == CHOOSE x \in s \cup {0} : \A y \in s : x >= y

\* CCF: Return the index of the latest committable message 
\*      (i.e., the last one that was signed by a leader)
MaxCommittableIndex(xlog) == 
    \* If the log contains messages and has at least one signature message
    IF Len(xlog) > 0 /\ \E s \in 1..Len(xlog) : xlog[s].contentType = TypeSignature
    THEN
    \* Choose that index..
    CHOOSE x \in 1..Len(xlog) : 
        \* That points to a signature message in log of node i
        /\ xlog[x].contentType = TypeSignature 
        \* And that is either the largest index in log of i
        /\ \A y \in 1..Len(xlog) : 
            \/ x >= y 
            \* Or that is only succeeeded by a postfix of unsigned commits
            \/ xlog[y].contentType = TypeEntry
    ELSE 0

\* I believe that the election safety property in the Raft
\* paper is stronger than it needs to be and requires history
\* variables. The definition ElectionSafety is an invariant that
\* is strong enough without requiring history variables. First,
\* we state two properties which will allow us to conclude election
\* safety

\* for the leader or have a higher term

\* are no log entries with that candidate's term

\* A leader has all committed entries in its log. This is expressed
\* by LeaderCompleteness below. The inductive invariant for
\* that property is the conjunction of LeaderCompleteness with the
\* other three properties below.

\* Votes are only granted to servers with logs
\* that are at least as up to date
\* However we limit this check to only apply while there is no leader selected
\* for the current term yet.
\* Otherwise, we run into issues with working leaders extending their log 
\* and throwing an error because they had voted for someone else earlier.

        \* a prefix of i's log, not the entire 
        \* log of j
        IsPrefix(Committed(j),log[i])

===============================================================================

\* Changelog:
\* CCF version of TLA model
\* 2021-05:
\* - Removed the following features from the model:
\*   - Restart (In CCF, no restart possible. Crashed nodes will not recover but
\*     will need to be added again in a configuration change.)
\*   - DuplicateMessage (In CCF, message encryption catches duplicated messages
\*     before they are passed on to the Raft protocol level)
\* - Added the following features to the model:
\*   - SignCommittableMessages: In CCF the leader signs the last messages which
\*     only makes them committed after this signature has been committed.
\* 
\* Original Raft changelog:
\* 2014-12-02:
\* - Fix AppendEntries to only send one entry at a time, as originally
\*   intended. Since SubSeq is inclusive, the upper bound of the range should
\*   have been nextIndex, not nextIndex + 1. Thanks to Igor Kovalenko for
\*   reporting the issue.
\* - Change matchIndex' to matchIndex (without the apostrophe) in
\*   AdvanceCommitIndex. This apostrophe was not intentional and perhaps
\*   confusing, though it makes no practical difference (matchIndex' equals
\*   matchIndex). Thanks to Hugues Evrard for reporting the issue.
