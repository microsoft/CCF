---- MODULE SingleNode ----
\* A lightweight specification to define the externally visible behaviour of CCF
\* This specification has been inspired by https://github.com/tlaplus/azure-cosmos-tla
\* Where possible, naming should be consistent with https://microsoft.github.io/CCF/main/index.html
\* SingleNode considers a single node CCF service, so no view changes

EXTENDS ExternalHistoryInvars, TLC


\* Abstract ledgers that contain transactions
\* Indexed by view, each ledger is the ledger associated with leader of that view 
\* In practice, the ledger of every CCF node is one of these or a prefix for one of these
VARIABLES ledgerBranches

LedgerTypeOK ==
    \A view \in DOMAIN ledgerBranches:
        \A seqnum \in DOMAIN ledgerBranches[view]:
            \* Each ledger entry is a record containing a view and optionally a tx
            \* The ledger entry index is its sequence number
            /\ ledgerBranches[view][seqnum].view \in Views

TypeOK ==
    /\ HistoryTypeOK
    /\ LedgerTypeOK

\* In this abstract version of CCF's consensus layer, each ledger is append-only
\* Each ledger branch is the log of a leader in a view and thus is not overwritten/rolled back
