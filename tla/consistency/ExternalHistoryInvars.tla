\* Read-only transaction responses always follow an associated request
\* Note that since multiple read requests can receive the same transaction ID this
\* invariant specifies only that at least one request was sent before the responses.

\* A transaction status cannot be both committed and invalid
CommittedOrInvalidInv ==

\* All committed read-write txs observe all previously committed txs (wrt to real-time)
\* Note that this requires committed txs to be observed from their response, 
\* not just from when the client learns they were committed
AllCommittedObservedInv ==

\* All committed read-only txs observe all previously committed txs (wrt to real-time)

\* Invalid requests are not observed by any other requests
\* This is vacuously true for single node CCF services and does not hold for multi node services
InvalidNotObservedInv ==

        /\ history[j].type = TxStatusReceived

\* not observed by committed requests

\* A history is serializable if there exists an execution sequence which is consistent 
\* with client observations. This property completely ignores the order of events.
\* If any request observes A before B then every request must observe A before B
\* In this model, every request execution observes itself
\* This invariant ignores transaction IDs and whether transactions are committed
\* This invariant only holds for a single node CCF service
RwSerializableInv ==

        => \/ IsPrefix(history[i].observed, history[j].observed)
           \/ IsPrefix(history[j].observed, history[i].observed)

\* A weaker version of RwSerializableInv which only considers committed requests
\* If any committed request observes A before B then every committed request must observe A before B
CommittedRwSerializableInv ==
    \A i, j \in RwTxResponseEventIndexes:
        \A k, l \in CommittedEventIndexes:
            \* Event k is the committed status received for the transaction in event i

\* Linearizability for read-write transactions
