\* Global variables

\* Each server keeps track of the active configurations.
\* This includes the current configuration plus any pending configurations.
\* The current configuration is the initial configuration or the last committed reconfiguration.
\* The pending configurations are reconfiguration transactions that are not yet committed.
\* Each server's configurations is indexed by the reconfiguration transaction index,
\* except for the initial configuration which has index 0 (note that the log in 1-indexed).
\* Refer to LogConfigurationConsistentInv for more on configurations

ConfigurationsTypeInv ==

        /\ \A c \in DOMAIN configurations[i] :

\* The set of servers that have been removed from configurations.  The implementation
\* assumes that a server refrains from rejoining a configuration if it has been removed
\* from an earlier configuration (relying on the TEE and absent Byzantine fault). Here,
\* we model removedFromConfiguration as a global variable. In the implementation, this
\* state has to be maintained by each node separately.
\* Note that we cannot determine the removed servers from configurations because a prefix
\* of configurations is removed from the configuration on a change of configuration.
\* TODO: How does the implementation keep track of removed servers?  Can we remove and
\* TODO: re-add a server in a raft_scenario test?

\* A set representing requests and responses sent from one server

\* CCF: Reconfiguration of servers
\* In the TLA+ model, a reconfiguration is initiated by the Leader which appends an arbitrary new configuration to its own log.
\* This also triggers a change in the Configurations variable which keeps track of all running configurations.
\* In the following, this Configurations variable is then checked to calculate a quorum and to check which nodes should be contacted or received messages from.

\* Leader can propose a change in the current configuration.
\* This will switch the current set of servers to the proposed set, ONCE BOTH
\* sets of servers have committed this message (in the adjusted configuration
\* this means waiting for the signature to be committed)

    \* i.e., be re-added to a new configuration.  Instead, the node has to rejoin with a
    \* "fresh" identity (compare sec 6.2, page 8, https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11559).

\* In CCF and with reconfiguration, the following limitations apply:
\*  - An index can only be committed if it is agreed upon by a Quorum in the
\*    old AND in the new configurations. This means that for any given index,
\*    all configurations of at least that index need to have a quorum of
