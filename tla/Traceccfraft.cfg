\* A trace specification defines a set of one or more traces, wherein the value of some
\* variables in each state aligns with the values specified on the corresponding line
\* of the log or trace file. Commonly, the log file might be incomplete, failing to
\* provide the value of all variables. In such instances, the omitted values are
\* determined non-deterministically, adhering to the high-level specification's parameters.
\* Furthermore, a trace may not be complete such that it only matches a prefix of the log.
SPECIFICATION
    TraceSpec

VIEW
    TraceView

\* Some of the traces in TraceSpec may not refine the high-level specification ccfraft.
\* Those traces will cause the trace validator to report a counterexample even if 
\* TraceSpec contains a trace that refines ccfraft and fully matches the log file.
\* The real property to check is that TraceSpec contains a trace that refines ccfraft and
\* matches the full log.  However, TLA cannot check this property directly because it
\* is a hyperproperty.
PROPERTIES
    CCFSpec

\* TLA has only limited support for hyperproperties.  The following property is a poorman's
\* hyperproperty that asserts that TLC generated *at least one* trace that fully matches the
\* log file. 
PROPERTIES
    TraceMatched

\* Checking for deadlocks during trace validation is disabled, as it may lead to false
\* counterexamples. A trace specification defines a set of traces, where at least one
\* trace is expected to match the log file in terms of variable values and length.
\* However, partial matches may occur where the trace cannot be extended to fully
\* correspond with the log file. In such cases, deadlock checking would report the first
\* of these traces.
