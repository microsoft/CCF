This folder implements a new governance API.
This API is defined in the root-level `typespec-ccf` folder, with a TypeSpec source generating an OpenAPI definition.

It aims to expose all of the functionality of the existing API, defined in `src/node/rpc/member_frontend.h`, but with naming and schemas compliant with Azure API standards.

For a transition period (at least the 4.x release), both APIs will be offered. The plan is to eventually deprecate the old API.

Implementation notes:

- All endpoints validate and process an `api-version` parameter, modifying their behaviour accordingly.
- To present both under the `/gov` prefix, the old frontend is a subclass of the new frontend.
- The frontend implementation is split into distinct components which can be more easily moved around, rather than a single monolithic frontend implementation.
