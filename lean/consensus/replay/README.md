# CCF consensus protocol trace replay

Replay native `cft_driver` captures against the Lean model of the CCF consensus protocol.
The existing `cft_scenario_test` collects native traces; `consensus-replay` validates one trace per invocation.

## Run replay

Install the [native build prerequisites](../../../doc/contribute/build_ccf.rst), [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/install/) and Python `msgpack`.
The Lean version is [pinned](../../lean-toolchain).
From `lean/consensus`, build the validator and validate a saved trace:

```sh
lake build --wfail consensus-replay
./.lake/build/bin/consensus-replay path/to/trace.ndjson
```

To generate captures, build the native driver and run the existing scenario test.
Use a fresh build directory to avoid replaying stale captures from earlier runs.
This needs Python `msgpack` available to CTest:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
cmake -S ../.. -B /tmp/cft-build -GNinja
cmake --build /tmp/cft-build --target cft_driver
ctest --test-dir /tmp/cft-build -VV -R '^cft_scenario_test$' --no-tests=error
for trace in /tmp/cft-build/consensus/raw/*.ndjson; do
  ./.lake/build/bin/consensus-replay "$trace"
done
```

The scenario runner writes the raw records to `consensus/raw/`.
The Fluentd tag is `ccf.cft`; packet message names are unprefixed, for example `append_entries` and `request_vote`.

## Replay contract

Every protocol event must match a named rule; bootstrap selects the initial singleton membership.
Rules group related protocol events and read action inputs from those events; only top-level alternatives backtrack.
Actions must be enabled by the model.
After bootstrap, each rule emits one read-only observation before its model actions, comparing the native group's entry snapshot with the current model state.

A receive delivers any queued model envelope from its sender whose rendered packet has exactly the native packet's fields, with equal values.
It delivers the queued **model payload**, not reconstructing unrecorded native bytes; if matching envelopes differ in payload, for example in AppendEntries entries, which packets omit, replay fails with an ambiguous delivery.
An envelope that is never delivered stays queued, which models loss, so `drop_pending_to` emits no observation or action.

## Source and checks

- [`Input.lean`](../Consensus/Replay/Input.lean): decode events, carry optional command provenance and collect identities.
- [`Reduction.lean`](../Consensus/Replay/Reduction.lean): named rules, explicit boundaries and rule-tagged snapshot checks.
- [`Interpreter.lean`](../Consensus/Replay/Interpreter.lean): boundary-state field comparisons, packet selection and model execution.
- [`ReplayMain.lean`](ReplayMain.lean): single-trace validation CLI.
- [`ReplayDelivery.lean`](../Consensus/Tests/ReplayDelivery.lean): delivery selection among equal rendered packets.
- [`cft_scenarios_runner.py`](../../../tests/cft_scenarios_runner.py): existing native scenario runner and capture generation.

See [failure fixtures](fixtures/README.md) for examples and expected diagnostics.
